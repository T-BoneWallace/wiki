# Joni "Jones" Bones

Joni "Jones" Bones is one the meanest cats in Toronto. She was adopted as a kitten by a Trombone playing full-stack developer by the name of [T-Bone Wallace](/wiki/Tbone). Since then she has been on a rampaging mission to destroy all her enemies, both small and large. 

Her favorite food is canned Ocean Delights by whiskas. 

She also loves eating catnip and spider plants whenever she can.
